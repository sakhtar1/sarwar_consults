# SarwarConsults

When you're a small business and you're looking to grow your company, advertisement plays a huge role. SarwarConsults gem was created to make it easy for these small businesses to analyze and figure out what they're looking for through answering a few questions. Once they answer the questions, they are presented with the information that best fits their requirements.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sarwar_consults'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sarwar_consults

## Usage

1. User opens the gem
2. The first question gives a list of services
3. User chooses a service from the list provided
4. Once the information for the specific service is provided, user is allowed to look at another service, or click on the url provided with the content of the selected service
4. There is also a sign up url, if at any point the user wants to sign up, they can write "sign up" and the link to Sign Up will display
5. If user wants to exit at any time, typing "exit" will exit the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
